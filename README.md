# DevOps Training Exercises and Solutions

### Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of hands-on exercises and their solutions completed during a one-month intensive training program in **DevOps** and **Cloud Computing**. It reflects my practical experience and understanding of core DevOps principles and tools.

### Key Learning Areas

Throughout the training, I gained practical proficiency in the following domains:

* **Linux Commands:** Fundamental and advanced command-line operations for system administration.
* **Bash Scripting:** Automating tasks, managing processes, and orchestrating workflows using shell scripts.
* **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Interacting with various AWS services for cloud infrastructure management.
* **Terraform:** Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage cloud resources efficiently.
* **Docker:** Containerizing applications, managing images, and running containers.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each containing exercises and solutions related to a specific topic or project from the training program. You'll find a variety of files, including:

* `.tf` files for Terraform configurations.
* `.sh` files for Bash scripts.
* `Dockerfile`s for containerization.

### How to Use This Repository

This repository is primarily a showcase of completed work. To explore the solutions:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-github-username>/devops-training-exercises.git
    cd devops-training-exercises
    ```
2.  **Navigate to Specific Exercises:** Browse through the folders to find exercises of interest. Each folder typically contains the relevant code and might have its own `README.md` with specific instructions or explanations for that particular exercise.
3.  **Review Code:** Examine the `.tf` files, `.sh` scripts, and application code to understand the implementations.

**Note:** To run or test specific Terraform or Docker exercises, you will need to have the respective tools installed and configured on your local machine, along with appropriate AWS credentials.
